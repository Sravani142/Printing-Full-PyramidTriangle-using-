# Printing-Full-PyramidTriangle-using-*
This is first repository

As you can understand to print triangle, we would first need to print a space("") for number of time then asterisk(*) then new line(/n), and repeat the procedure.

//Set n value in temp because this is help us print blank space before printing *

//now we need temp as we need to keep value of "n" same through out the program

//but "temp" value will be decreased after each loop

let's start with outer loop to loop through rows which will be dependent on variable "n"

// here c start with 1 and will keep printing space util it's value is greater current "temp" value

//decrese temp value to print one less space next time we loop

//now loop to print *, check formular here it is 2n-1 this is because

//we need to print * odd number of times to get our pattern out
